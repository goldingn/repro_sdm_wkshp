# Practical exercises for session 3 - accounting for observation bias

# The aim of this practical is to play with different ways of accounting
# for observation bias in presence-only SDMs and look at the effects of
# not accounting for it. We'll look at incorporating a 'bias grid' approach
# and the 'reference set background' approach.

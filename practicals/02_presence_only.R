# Practical exercises for session 2 - presence-absence versus presence-only SDMs

# The aim of this practical is to experiment with different types of
# presence-only SDM model and how they differ to presence/absence SDMs.
# We'll compare the 'naive' presence-only model with Maxent,
# play around with generating background points and explore different sources
# of presence-absence data 

# clear workspace

# Workshop timetable:

8.45-9.00	**Arrival, coffee and settling down time**

9.00-9.30	**Seminar: **Introduction to SDM

* Geographic vs. environmental space
* The niche as a function
* Modelling ‘probability of presence’
* Diversity of methods

9.30-10.30	**Practical:** Fitting an SDM

* Fit a simple presence/absence SDM in a ZOON workflow
* Make prediction maps
* Switch between covariate datasets
* Switch between models

10.30-11.00	**Tea/Coffee break**

11.00-11.30	**Seminar:** Presence/absence vs presence-only data

* Presence/absence model assumptions 
* Different models for presence-only data

11.30-12.30	**Practical: **Fitting different presence-only models

* The ‘naive’ approach - presence/absence models with pseudo-absence points  [reference: Elith?, Ward]
* MaxEnt  [reference: Phillips et al. x2]
* Poisson GLMs  [reference: Warton & Renner]

12.30-13.30	**Lunch & Tutorial:** principles of reproducibility

* Writing self-contained scripts
* Portability
* Readibility

13.30-14.00	**Seminar:** Observation bias in presence-only data

* Different sources of presence only data
* Different forms of spatial bias in these data
* What happens if you don’t account for it

14.00 - 15.00	**Practical:** Accounting for observation bias

* The reference group approach [reference: Phillips et al. (2009)]
* Comparing these approaches on a fake dataset

15.00-15.30	**Tea/Coffee break**

15.30 - 16.00	**Seminar:** Model validation

* in-sample vs. out-of-sample validation
* overfitting
* properties of different validation metrics [reference: Lawson et al. (2014) MEE; Wengler & Olden (2012) MEE]

16.00 - 17.00	**Practical: **Comparing different validation datasets

* Loop through multiple analyses to compute in-sample and out-of-sample validation statistics
* Compare performance of different models on random and geographically stratified hold-out data

# Workshop timetable:

8.45-9.00	**Arrival, coffee and settling down time**

9.00-9.30	**Introduction, reproducibility sales pitch and installing things**

* Who we (the many organisers) are
* Why reproducibility is good for ecologists
* Why it's good for ecology
* What zoon aims to do

9.30-10.00	**Seminar:** Introduction to SDM

* Geographic vs. environmental space
* The niche as a function
* Modelling ‘probability of presence’
* Diversity of methods

10.00-11.00	**Practical:** Fitting an SDM

* Fit a simple presence/absence SDM in a ZOON workflow
* Make prediction maps
* Switch between covariate datasets
* Switch between models

11.00-11.30	**Tea/Coffee break**

11.30-12.00	**Seminar:** Presence/absence vs presence-only data

* Presence/absence model assumptions 
* Different models for presence-only data

12.00-13.00	**Practical:** Fitting different presence-only models

* The ‘naive’ approach - presence/absence models with pseudo-absence points  [reference: Elith?, Ward]
* MaxEnt  [reference: Phillips et al. x2]
* Poisson GLMs  [reference: Warton & Renner]

13.00-13.30	**Lunch** 

* Breathing a deep sigh of relief

13.30-14.00	**Seminar:** Observation bias in presence-only data

* Different sources of presence only data
* Different forms of spatial bias in these data
* What happens if you don’t account for it

14.00 - 15.00	**Practical:** Accounting for observation bias

* The reference group approach [reference: Phillips et al. (2009)]
* Comparing these approaches on a fake dataset

15.00-15.30	**Tea/Coffee break**

15.30 - 16.00	**Seminar:** Model validation

* In-sample vs. out-of-sample validation
* Overfitting
* Properties of different validation metrics [reference: Lawson et al. (2014) MEE; Wengler & Olden (2012) MEE]

16.00 - 16.30	**Practical:** Comparing different validation datasets

* In-sample versus out-of-sample validation statistics
* k-fold random versus geographically-stratified CV

16.30 - 17.00	**zoon Feedback & SDM clinic**

* What do you think of the aims/niche of zoon?
* What do you think of the software?
* What would need to be changed before you'd use it in a paper?

* Ask us any questions about your SDM analysis!

# Reproducible SDM Training Workshop
### Materials for the Training Workshop on Reproducible Species Distribution Modelling run by the [BES](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/)'s [Quantitative Ecology](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/quantitative-ecology) and [Macroecology](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/macroecology) Special Interest Groups and the [ZOÓ¦N project](https://zoonproject.wordpress.com) of [2020 Science](http://www.2020science.net)

This training workshop aims to provide a brief introduciton to SDM analyses, highlighting common pitfalls and some solutions to them and helping attendees to carry out these analyses in repreoducible way, so that they can re-use them in the future and share them with others.
The practical sessions are all intended to be completed in R, using the `zoon` R package which aims to make SDM analyses easier to carry out and to share with others.

#### Practicals

Incomplete R scripts for each of the workshop practical sessions can be found in the [practicals](folder).

The idea is for attendees to save a copy of each of these R scripts and to add to them throughout the workshop.
At the end of the workshop, everyone should therefore have a library of reproducible scripts for running a range of SDMs to take home and re-use.

At the top of each script is the command: `rm(list = ls())`  which clears all objects from the workspace.

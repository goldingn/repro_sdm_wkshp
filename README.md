# Reproducible SDM Training Workshop
### Materials for the Training Workshop on Reproducible Species Distribution Modelling run by the [BES](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/)'s [Quantitative Ecology](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/quantitative-ecology) and [Macroecology](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/macroecology) Special Interest Groups and the [ZOӦN project](https://zoonproject.wordpress.com) of [2020 Science](http://www.2020science.net)

This training workshop aims to provide a brief introduciton to SDM analyses, highlighting common pitfalls and some solutions to them and helping attendees to carry out these analyses in repreoducible way, so that they can re-use them in the future and share them with others.
The practical sessions are all intended to be completed in R, using the [`zoon` R package](https://github.com/zoonproject/zoon) which aims to make SDM analyses easier to carry out and to share with others.


#### Workshop timetable

There is a rough timetable for the workshop [here](https://github.com/goldingn/repro_sdm_wkshp/blob/master/timetable/timetable.md) but note that it is subject to change!

#### Getting started

#### Seminars

#### Practicals

Incomplete R scripts for each of the workshop practical sessions can be found in the [practicals](folder).

The idea is for attendees to save a copy of each of these R scripts and to add to them throughout the workshop.
At the end of the workshop, everyone should therefore have a library of reproducible scripts for running a range of SDMs to take home and re-use.

At the top of each script is the command: `rm(list = ls())`  which clears all objects from the workspace.

N.B. fiddling with code and bugging the helpers during breaks is actively encouraged!

Users must bring their own laptop computers as none will be provided. Before arriving, please make sure you have a working version of R (**version?**) installed and have installed the [zoon R package](https://github.com/zoonproject/zoon) (installation details here: [https://github.com/zoonproject/zoon](https://github.com/zoonproject/zoon), note this may take a little longer for Windows users, as you’ll need to install RTools first (see here: [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) then here: [https://zoonproject.wordpress.com/2014/09/16/61/](https://zoonproject.wordpress.com/2014/09/16/61/)).
